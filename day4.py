# Problem:
# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

import time

# this is not a good general solution, but works well for this specific problem.
# the odds that the palindrome will exist as a * b for some integers a and b > 900 is likely
